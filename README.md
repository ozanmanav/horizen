- Description (optional, max 500 characters)
- Priority dropdown (High, Medium, Low)
- Due date picker
- Form validation with error messages

**A: Requirements:**
- Use controlled components
- Implement form validation
- Show error states
- Clear form after submission
- Use proper TypeScript types

### Question 5: Styling & UX (10 minutes)

- Smooth animations/transitions
- Loading states
- Empty state when no tasks
- Responsive design for mobile
- Hover effects and micro-interactions

**A: Requirements:**
- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow the existing design system
- Ensure accessibility (proper ARIA labels)
- Smooth user experience

### Question 6: Advanced Features (5 minutes)
**Q: Add ONE of the following features:**
- Search functionality to filter tasks
- Sort tasks by priority or due date
- Drag and drop to reorder tasks
- Export tasks to JSON

**A: Choose based on your strengths and time remaining**

## Evaluation Criteria

### Code Quality (30%)

- Proper TypeScript usage
- Component structure and reusability
- Error handling

### Functionality (25%)
- All requirements implemented
- App works without bugs
- Edge cases handled
- Form validation works

### Styling & UX (25%)
- Responsive design
- Consistent styling
- Good user experience
- Accessibility considerations

### Problem Solving (20%)
- Approach to complex features
- Code organization
- Time management
- Creative solutions

## Starter Code
The project includes:
- ‚úÖ Basic project setup with React, TypeScript, Tailwind
- ‚úÖ Design system and component library (shadcn/ui)
- ‚úÖ Routing setup
- ‚è≥ **Your task:** Complete the task management application

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Open `http://localhost:8080`
5. Start coding!

## Submission Guidelines
- Complete as many questions as possible within 60 minutes
- Commit your code frequently
- Add comments explaining complex logic
- If you run out of time, document what you would implement next

## Time Management Tips
- Spend 5 minutes planning your approach
- Focus on core functionality first
- Polish and styling should come after basic features work
- Don't get stuck on one feature - move on and come back if time permits

## Bonus Points
- Adding unit tests
- Implementing keyboard shortcuts
- Adding animations with Framer Motion
- Using React Hook Form for advanced form handling
- Implementing custom hooks for reusable logic

Good luck! üöÄ
